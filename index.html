      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        When I am not taking care of the house and yard or taking care of the
        animals I usually spend my time playing online games with friends and
        others, the game that I have been on the most lately is Age of Empires 2
        and Factorio. I will also catch the occasional netflix/Hulu show and
        keep it on for background sound while i am doing other things.
