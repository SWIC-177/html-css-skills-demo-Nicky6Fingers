        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          When I am not taking care of the house and yard or taking care of the
          animals I usually spend my time playing online games with friends and
          others, the game that I have been on the most lately is Age of Empires
          2 and Factorio. I will also catch the occasional netflix/Hulu show and
          keep it on for background sound while i am doing other things.
